# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    In Prebuilt: No longer increments the counter for tcp retransmits when tcp_retransmit_skb returns a non-zero exit code. 
    In Runtime Compiled: Does the above, but additionally forgoes the usage of the segs parameter in tcp_retransmit_skb for 
    the value retrans_out, a member of the tcp_sock type. retrans_out is a monotonic counter, so we calculate the difference 
    between its value in the kprobe and kretprobe and use that delta to increment tcp retransmits.
