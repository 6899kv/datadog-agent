# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add tagger parse to support envirable varible in format of "%%env_XXXXX%%". 
    For example, add the following template variable to ad.datadoghq.com/tags or com.datadoghq.ad.tags
      "available_zone": "%%env_AVAILABILITY_ZONE%%"
    %%env_AVAILABILITY_ZONE%% will be replaced by the env var in the tagger
