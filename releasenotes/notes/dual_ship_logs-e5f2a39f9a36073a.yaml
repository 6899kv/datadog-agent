    Enable dual shipping of logs. Set `logs_config.logs_dd_backup_url` to 
    a backup host and port and the agent will send all logs there as well. 
    If one of the 2 endpoints goes down, logs will still be sent to the working 
    one. If both endpoints go down, the pipeline is blocked until one recovers 
    ensuring no logs are lost.
