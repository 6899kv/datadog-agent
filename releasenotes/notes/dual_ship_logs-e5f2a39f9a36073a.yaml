    Enable dual shipping of logs. Set `logs_config.logs_backup_api_key` to
    a backup org and the agent will send all logs there as well. If one of the
    2 endpoints goes down, logs will still be sent to the working one. If both
    endpoints go down, the pipeline is blocked until one recovers ensuring no
    logs are lost.
