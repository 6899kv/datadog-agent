    APM - This change improves the acceptance and queueing strategy for trace
    payloads sent to the trace agent. These changes create a system of
    backpressure in the trace agent, causing it to reject payloads when it
    cannot keep up with the rate of traffic, rather than buffering and causing
    OOM issues.
    
    This change includes several configuration options which can be used to
    control the queue parameters, although they should not usually need to
    be adjusted, as the defaults have been tested and confirmed to be good
    for both very low load and very high load.
    
    These configuration options are:
    apm_config.trace_buffer / DD_APM_TRACE_BUFFER:
      this controls the size of the buffer that holds traces which were accepted
      and decoded, but are waiting to be processed. In practice this should not
      be adjusted, as it does not increase throughput, but balloons the RAM usage
      of the trace agent considerably. The only time when this may be useful is for
      extremely bursty, large loads.

    apm_config.decoders / DD_APM_DECODERS:
      this controls the number of simultaneous goroutines that are allowed to decode
      payloads. By default, this is max(1, 0.5 * (# cores allowed to the trace agent))
      which is the same as the number of processing workers. This is enough to keep
      the processor routines busy without creating CPU contention or expanding RAM.

    apm_config.decoder_timeout / DD_APM_DECODER_TIMEOUT:
      this controls how long decoders will wait for a turn to decode a payload. There
      are a limited number of simultaneous decoders allowed (controlled by
      apm_config.decoders), and when there are more payloads being submitted, they wait
      for a turn to be decoded. Under heavy load, this can cause long delays. The timeout
      ensures that client tracers don't wait indefinitely for a response. The default
      timeout is 1 second, after which the trace agent will send a 429 Too Many Requests.

    apm_config.max_connections / DD_APM_MAX_CONNECTIONS:
      this controls the maximum number of active network connections that are allowed
      into the agent's http server. This number's default 1000, which is high enough that
      it should not come into play except for agents with extreme numbers of clients.
      In practice, we should not expect to see this limit reached and it is only here
      to prevent accidental or intentional denial-of-service attacks on the trace agent.
